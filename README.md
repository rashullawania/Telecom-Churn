## Telecom_Churn_Analysis

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. So we need to analyse telecom industry data and predict high value customers who are at high risk of churn and identify main indicators of churn. In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, .






## Project Files Description

This project includes a colab notebook, a data source :


## Problem Statement

The Orange Telecom's churn dataset consist of cleaned customer activity data(Features) along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription , explore and analyze to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up ways to recommendation customer satisfaction
## Data Summary

We have given dataset in CSV file firstly import required libraries using in explaration data and in this dataset 3333 rows and 20 columns and this dataset contained integers, Float , booleans values & checkfor duplicate and missing value not present in data using heatmap.




## Data Insights:

The data must be interpreted and manipulated to be accessible by humans to clean and map it to provide valuable insights. The need for data manipulation becomes even more important with a growing volume of data being used and processed and most of customer in 'WV' State and take time in calling and minimum area code is '1'

85.5 % customers cancelled the subscription and remain will take subscription

More than 50% of the subscription in Total charge is atleast more than 50% of the fares in Total minutes and Total calls

 customer who have already take voice mail plan is not much interested to take subscription but customer who take international plan is favour of taking subscription
## Conclusion
As we can see Visualization and variables for making business decision to decrease or stop customer from churning who are likely to churn. Telcom company can introduce 'International plan' to those customers who are likely to churn. Also, and 0,1,2,,4 customer service calls effected and Account length is bad impact on likely to accept subscription. Now, Business people can make decision on those most important preidctor variables. Since, we have use different models for predicting these feature variable and difference techniques for feature selection we are getting similar predicting variable but order is slightly different. Hence we recommend Telecom company to consider these feature variables which are strong indicators to manage customer churn.

We have 85.5% like to churn and other 14.5% not like

Data set shows that some who have take international plan ae interested likely to churn Only 10% Customer who take voice mail plan are like to churn There is no trend behaviour between state but state who have customer belong to average are interested to take subscription Churn rate graph are normally distributed about total charge and total call 0,1,2, &4 customer service calls effected on churnrate on likely to churn We have maximum customer like to churn 'MA', 'MD', 'ME', 'MI', 'MO', 'MS', 'MT'
